## Source import
- Preserve the imported ROUT TanStack Start routes, design system, assets and MDX catalog plugin because this is a full source import, not a GitHub webpage copy.
- Never copy source environment files, repository metadata, generated route trees or integration bindings because connections and credentials belong to this project.
- Keep the source cookie-based account system separate from Cloud bearer middleware until an explicit account migration because existing user data was not transferred.
- The standalone worker is retained as source only and requires separate deployment because it cannot run within request-bound app hosting.

## Repository import boundaries
- Preserve the imported ROUT source architecture and external-service adapters; do not selectively rebuild pages, because the import must retain functionality.
- Retain this project’s managed integration files and repository metadata; never replace them with another project’s connection identifiers or credentials.
- Keep database SQL as source only until the intended existing service is connected and reviewed; copying code does not authorize migrating live data.
